Here, we describe the development of a CRISPR-Cas-inspired RNA targeting system (CIRTS) and utilize network theory to identify and target the most essential viral CoV proteins within the human-CoV protein-protein interactome. By utilizing network theory concepts including centrality and clique analysis, we identified Nsp12 and Nsp12 as the most critical viral CoV proteins.

The "human_cov_neighbors" notebook contains connected component analysis, network centrality calculations, and clique analysis for the human-CoV dataset from Gordon et al. 2020 Nature as well as the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree neighbors of this dataset derived from BioPlex. The "human_cov_+_bioplex" notebook contains connected component analysis, network centrality calculations, and clique analysis for the human-CoV dataset combined with all of Bioplex.
